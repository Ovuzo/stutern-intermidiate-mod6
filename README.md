# List five significant features of React

Declarative: React is declarative, which means that developers can describe what the UI should look like, and React will take care of the underlying details of how to update the UI when the state changes. This makes it easier to reason about the code and helps to prevent bugs.

Component-based: React is built around the idea of components, which are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to build complex interfaces. Components are modular and encapsulated, making it easier to reason about their behavior and reuse them throughout an application.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the UI. The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM that React uses to keep track of changes. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the actual DOM by only making the necessary changes.

One-way data flow: React uses a one-way data flow, which means that data flows in a single direction from the parent component to the child components. This makes it easier to reason about how data is changing and helps to prevent unexpected changes.

JSX: React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. This makes it easier to reason about the structure of the UI and helps to prevent bugs that can arise from mixing HTML and JavaScript.

Hooks: React Hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components, which makes it easier to write and reason about code. Hooks provide a way to reuse logic between components, without the need for class components or higher-order components.


## List five major advantages of React


Reusable Components: React's component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application. This results in more efficient development and easier maintenance.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to keep track of changes to the UI. This allows it to update the actual DOM more efficiently, resulting in faster rendering times and improved performance.

One-way Data Binding: React uses one-way data binding, which simplifies the process of managing state and makes it easier to debug code.

SEO-Friendly: React can be used for server-side rendering, which improves the SEO of web applications by generating HTML on the server before sending it to the client.

Large and Active Community: React has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources and tools available to help developers get up to speed and troubleshoot issues.

## Question 5
## What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. While
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used with the React library for building user interfaces.


##

Browsers cannot read JSX because it is not valid JavaScript. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used with the React library to define and render user interfaces. It is essentially a way to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

JSX needs to be transpiled, or converted, into regular JavaScript code that browsers can understand. This is typically done using a build tool like Babel, which converts JSX syntax into regular JavaScript code.

When the code is compiled, all the JSX elements are replaced with function calls to create React elements. These function calls are then executed by the browser's JavaScript engine, which creates and renders the actual HTML elements on the page.

In summary, browsers cannot read JSX directly because it is not valid JavaScript, but it can be transpiled into JavaScript using tools like Babel, which allows it to be executed and rendered by the browser's JavaScript engine.
